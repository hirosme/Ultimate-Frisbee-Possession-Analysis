# Ultimate-Frisbee-Possession-Analysis

Ultimate Frisbee is a growing sport internationally with a burgeoning 
professional scene. In the interest of developing the sport as well as
helping individual interested teams, this project aims to apply developed
sports analytics concepts from other more developed sports to frisbee.

The goal of all sports analytics research is to calculate to value of a
given action. This can either be personnel oriented -- how much will using
this player help the team -- or field strategy oriented -- how much will
making these in-game decisions help the team. 

Personnel oriented analysis is only useful if (a) a team has a certain level of freedom to reselect players to fit the results of the research, and (b) there is a level of independence between the actions of individual players allowing for independent value assignations. In a setting such as Major League Baseball, where each team has access to a nearly endless flow of different personnel options, and each game action is essentially limited to two players, this approach is optimal. However, in Ultimate frisbee, not only is the number of quality players much lower, but the task of separating one player's actions from the other 13 on the field at a given moment is daunting and would require significantly more data than is currently available.

Instead, we will focus on determining values for on field team strategies. The first fundamental
