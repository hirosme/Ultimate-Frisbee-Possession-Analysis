# Ultimate-Frisbee-Possession-Analysis

This project began as a low-level college ultimate expirement and has now been applied to 70k+ professional ultimate passes. UltiMaps is a strategic development tool for analyzing ultimate frisbee passes based on their start and end coordinates. This repository builds a Shiny webapp hosted at https://hirosme.shinyapps.io/UltiMaps/ from the original AUDL dataset scraped from https://theaudl.com/league/stats.

Future plans include: 
 - Applying data from AUDL's wearable body tracking system to account for defensive positioning.
 - Calculating individual player throw value scores
 - Adding filtering by player, team
