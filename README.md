# Ultimate-Frisbee-Possession-Analysis

This project began as a low college ultimate expirement and has now been applied to 70k+ professional ultimate passes. UltiMaps is a strategic development tool for analyzing ultimate frisbee passes based on their start and end coordinates. This repository builds a Shiny webapp hosted at https://hirosme.shinyapps.io/UltiMaps/ from the original AUDL dataset scraped from https://theaudl.com/league/stats.

Future plans include applying data from AUDL's wearable body tracking system to account for defensive positioning.
